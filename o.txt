if you're timid when you speak, it'll take a week
if you're looking on your shelf, don't throw away yourself
if you're packing up your bags, throw away the tags
if you're looking on your shelf, don't throw away yourself
if you're unsure what you'll wear, put your heart in there
if nothing seems funny, laugh at me
if you're missing sunshine, you'll have mine

bring your socks and headbands, call me when you land
bring your notebook and your pen, so you can make a plan
bring your toothbrush and your paste, so you can keep your taste
bring something special to wear, put your heart in there

jumbo jets and half steps, you can barely rest
triple rooms and single beds, you can lay your head
continents and hallways, you can leave today
